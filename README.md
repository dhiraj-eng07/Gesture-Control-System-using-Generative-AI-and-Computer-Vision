# Gesture-Control-System-using-Generative-AI-and-Computer-Vision
This project combines Computer Vision with Generative AI to build a smart, interactive gesture-controlled assistant. It detects hand gestures in real-time via webcam and uses Generative AI (GPT-4) to dynamically understand user intent, translate gestures into natural language, and perform system or application-level actions.
